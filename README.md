# Algorithms and Data Structures in Java

The repo consists of solutions to numerous problems using different data structures and algorithms, where all solutions are coded purely in Java. It also contains solutions to HackerRank problems which I have solved so far.

You can also refer my [Java Notes](http://java.ramswaroop.me) for a quick refresh on the Java concepts.
